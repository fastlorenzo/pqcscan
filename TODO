- [x] move TLS algo's etc to a JSON file like we do for SSH

- [ ] add experimental TLS algo's form the draft/deprecated RFCs and add an
      optional flag to also scan for these when doing SSH scanning

- [x] update the SSH KEX database with links/hrefs to each algorithm so that we can
      display these in the HTML output nicely and link through.

- [ ] rewrite the templates to not be so ridicuously large for 10s of 1000s of
      results possibly do this by simply generating a JSON list of all the results
      and rewrite the templates that all the elements are built up via pure JS
      instead of generated HTML

- [ ] add some combined JSON/CSV/XML export output on top of the HTML format
