- move TLS algo's etc to a JSON file like we do for SSH

- add experimental TLS algo's form the draft/deprecated RFCs and add an
  optional flag to also scan for these when doing SSH scanning

- update the SSH KEX database with links/hrefs to each algorithm so that we can
  display these in the HTML output nicely and link through.

- rewrite the templates to not be so ridicuously large for 10s of 1000s of
  results possibly do this by simply generating a JSON list of all the results
  and rewrite the templates that all the elements are built up via pure JS
  instead of generated HTML

- add some combined JSON/CSV/XML export output on top of the HTML format
